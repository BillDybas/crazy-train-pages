If you're interested in getting your hands on some SSE-brand apparel, the
Fundraising committee is who you will want to talk to.

The following things and more can be purchased from the fundraising committee or
any mentor on duty:

* T-Shirts
* Polos
* Stickers
* Padfolios
* Ties
* Drawstring Bags

Your donations help keep the SSE in business by allowing other committees to
purchase books or subsidize events for members.
